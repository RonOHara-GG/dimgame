Dimensions is a Sci-Fi Action RPG very much like Diablo.
 
The player starts out assigned by his or her commanding officer to investigate a disturbance on the new orbital space station. Apon arrival to the space station, the player finds out that the disturbance is actually a strange looking purple and blue swirling rift inside one of the ship docking bays. As the player approaches the rift for the first time, a wave of creatures emerges from the rift into the docking bay and begin to attack! Whatever these things are, they are hostile and must be dealt with!
 
The main story line is designed for a single player to push back the conquest army of the Giliarn. Each dimension has an alternate story line designed for multiple players which involves conquering the dimension's original inhabitants.
