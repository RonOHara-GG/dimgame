*Description:* <br/>
The butterfly kick is a signature martial arts kick. It's commonly done by doing a large circular motion with both feet in succession, making the combatant airborne. There are many variations of this kick. The kick may look like a slanted no handed cartwheel, and at the same time, the body spins horizontally in a circle. You would have to jump with one leg while kicking with the other, then move the kicking leg down and the jumping leg up into a kick, landing with the first kicking leg, all while spinning. It may also resemble a jumping spin roundhouse kick into a spinning hook kick, all in one jump and one spin.

This attack starts at S and ends at E, damaging everything in the X marked tiles. Enemies in the path of S -> E take half damage. Any enemies surviving the attack in the path of S -> E get pushed out of the way.
